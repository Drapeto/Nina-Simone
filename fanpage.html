      <h1>High Priestess of Soul - Nina Simone</h1>

      <p>Nina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon.Raised in a Methodist home  Nina Simone's mother did not approve of her playing in bars saying she was "working in the fires of hell". 
         Nina hid her identity using the nickname "Nina" from the Spanish word that means "little one". "Simone" is derived after the actress Simone Signoret.
         Nina produced 40 original songs but recognition did not come easy. Advanced technology like the internet, CD's, and media exposed fans to her revolutionary, deep, emotional, bluezy 
         sound. Her music would be featured in numerous big block buster films like <em>Training Day</em> and musicians like Lil Wayne sample her music. 
      </p>

      <p>Nina Simone was born with a musical gift. By the time she was age three she started playing the piano without being taught but just by listening. Johann Sebastian Bach, Chopin and 
         Beethoven were some of her classical influences. The people in her community believed so strongly in her talent that they raised enought money to get her a scholarship 
         into Julliard in New York. She was ultimately denied. Nina concluded that racism prevented her acceptance.
      </p>
        
      <p>There's no doubt that Nina Simone is timeless and lives on. Her lyrics resonate in all peoples lives and are as relevant today as they were in her day "...the solitary soul that
         understood the pain of being misunderstood."
